# Tag

Tags are a way to grant various access, assign restrictions or other kinds of metadata to various to objects such as worlds, users and avatars.  System tags starting with `system_` are granted automatically by the system, while admin tags with `admin_` are granted manually. More prefixes such as `language_ ` (to indicate that a player can speak the tagged language), and `author_tag_` (provided by a world author for search and sorting) exist as well.
